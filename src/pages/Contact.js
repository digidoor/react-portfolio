			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Though my original schooling was in Biomedical Engineering, it wasn't something
				I was passionate about nor did I enjoy. With many twists, turns, and diversions, I have
				again and again found myself circling back to the subject of the first class I ever
				took wherein I would start my homework the day it was assigned: programming. A frequent
				tinkerer and "hobbyist computer scientist" (as I've often described myself), I now have
				enough experience in building and deploying projects that I feel ready to turn a hobby
				and academic interest into a "career", whatever that means. At the end of the day, I'm
				just someone who finds programming fun =) .
			</p>
			<h1>Contact</h1>
			<h3>The best way to contact me is to open an issue in any of
				my <a href="https://github.com/digidoor?tab=repositories">github repos</a>.
			</h3>
			<h4>P.S. If you find that this site looks a bit garish, I wouldn't blame youâ€”color
				coordination is not my strong suite.</h4>
